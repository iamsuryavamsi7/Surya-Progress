	====== ====

	1)  Why Framework's ?
	A)  Framework's help us to start our work not from scratch and there will be some inbuilt template code and also many 
	    configuration's are already done by the framework itself.
	
	2)  What is Spring Boot?
	A)  Spring Boot is a one of the module of Spring Framework and it's present in top of Spring Framework. So, When we use
	    Spring Boot we are already using the spring framework. The main advantage of spring boot is many configuration's 
	    Which should be done in spring framework are already done in spring boot and we can save our time for configuration's
	    by this we can able to make our work faster.

		
	3)  What is Dependency Injection?
	A)  If a class needs the object of another class then we have to initialise the class to bring that object. But this action
	    will be done by spring itself and this also make our work faster.

	4)  What is AOP?
	A)  AOP means Aspect Oriented Programming.
